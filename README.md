# Prathama
Prathama is a sandbox, survival game that will serve as a proof of concept for my idea of how a blockchain-based multiplayer game should work. The basic idea is to run a game completely distributed (i.e. without any server) and use a blockchain to prevent cheating. Others have thought of this, but most of what I've seen are either scams or vaporware. My goal is to produce a game that's completely free, open-source, and fun.

I have little game dev and blockchain development experience along with no artistic sense, so chances are this won't be successful without help.

I have a lot of ideas written down, and as I figure out how to convey them I will update this readme.

I have little game dev and blockchain development experience along with no artistic sense, so chances are this won't be successful without help. But community engagement is what crypto is all about!

I'm working on filling out the issue page with trackers and any advice you can offer would be awesome.
